# Ruby [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) driver

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iconara/etcd-rb.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iconara/etcd-rb)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/iconara/etcd-rb/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/iconara/etcd-rb)

# Requirements

  - A modern Ruby, compatible with 1.9.3 or later. Continously tested with MRI 1.9.3, 2.0.0 and JRuby 1.7.x.
  - An etcd cluster.

# Installation

    gem install etcd-rb --prerelease

# Quick start

```ruby
require 'etcd'

client = Etcd::Client.connect(uris: 'http://localhost:4001')
client.connect
client.set('/foo', 'bar')
client.get('/foo')
```

See the full [API documentation](http://rubydoc.info/github/iconara/etcd-rb/master/frames) for more. All core features are supported, including test-and-set, TTL, watches -- as well as a few convenience features like continuous watching.



## Automatic Failover

```ruby
# start with
# $ sh/c to have NodeKiller available :)
seed_uris = ["http://127.0.0.1:4001", "http://127.0.0.1:4002", "http://127.0.0.1:4003"]
client = Etcd::Client.connect(:uris => seed_uris)


## set some values
client.set("foo", "bar")
client.get("foo") # => bar
client.get("does-not-exist") # => nil

## kill leader node
NodeKiller.kill_node(client.cluster.leader.name)

## client still trucking on
client.get("foo") # => bar

## we have visibility into cluster status
puts client.cluster.nodes.map(&:status) # => [:running, :down, :running]

# will leave only one process running by killing the next leader node
NodeKiller.kill_node(client.cluster.leader.name)
puts client.cluster.nodes.map(&:status) # => [:running, :down, :down]

# but since we have no leader with one process, all requests will fail
client.cluster.leader # => nil
client.get("foo") # raises AllNodesDownError error

## now start up the cluster in another terminal by executing
## `sh/start_cluster`

## client works again
client.get("foo") # => bar

```

# Features

## Continuous watches: observers

Most of the time when you use watches with etcd you want to immediately re-watch the key when you get a change notification. The `Client#observe` method handles this for you, including re-watching with the last seen index, so that you don't miss any updates.

```ruby
client = Etcd:Client.connect
client.connect
client.observe('/foo') do
  puts '/foo changed!'
end
```

## Automatic leader detection

You can point the client to any node in the etcd cluster, it will ask that node for the current leader and direct all subsequent requests directly to the leader to avoid unnecessary redirects. When the leader changes, detected by a redirect, the new leader will be registered and used instead of the previous.

## Automacic failover & retry

When connecting for the first time, and when the leader changes, the list of nodes in the cluster is cached. Should the node that the client is talking to become unreachable, the client will attempt to connect to the next known node, until it finds one that responds. The first node to respond will be asked for the current leader, which will then be used for subsequent request.

This is handled completely transparently to you.

Watches are a special case, since they use long polling, they will break when the leader goes down. Observers will attempt to reestablish their watches with the new leader.


# Development
    # make your changes
    $ sh/test


# Playing in shell
    # start a test cluster
    $ sh/start_cluster
    # load console with etcd-rb code
    $ sh/c
    > seed_uris = ["http://127.0.0.1:4001", "http://127.0.0.1:4002", "http://127.0.0.1:4003"]
    > client = Etcd::Client.connect(:uris => seed_uris)

# How to contribute


Fork the repository, make your changes in a topic branch that branches off from the right place in the history (HEAD isn't necessarily always right), make your changes and finally submit a pull request.

Follow the style of the existing code, make sure that existing tests pass, and that everything new has good test coverage. Put some effort into writing clear and concise commit messages, and write a good pull request description.

It takes time to understand other people's code, and even more time to understand a patch, so do as much as you can to make the maintainers' work easier. Be prepared for rejection, many times a feature is already planned, or the proposed design would be in the way of other planned features, or the maintainers' just feel that it will be faster to implement the features themselves than to try to integrate your patch.

Feel free to open a pull request before the feature is finished, that way you can have a conversation with the maintainers' during the development, and you can make adjustments to the design as you go along instead of having your whole feature rejected because of reasons such as those above. If you do, please make it clear that the pull request is a work in progress, or a request for comment.

Always remember that the maintainers' work on this project in their free time and that they don't work for you, or for your benefit. They have no obligation to do what you think is right -- but if you're nice they might anyway.
